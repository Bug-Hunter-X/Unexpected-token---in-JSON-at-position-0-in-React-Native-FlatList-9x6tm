# React Native FlatList: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using FlatList in React Native to render data fetched from an API. The error, "Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0", typically arises when the API response is not valid JSON, often due to server-side issues or network problems.  The solution involves robust error handling and checking the API response status before parsing it as JSON.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app on an emulator or device.
4. Observe the error message if the API request fails.

## Solution

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` addresses this issue by:

- Checking the `response.ok` status to verify a successful HTTP request.
- Using a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle errors during the fetch process.
- Displaying a user-friendly error message instead of crashing the app.

This approach ensures a more robust and user-friendly experience when handling potential API request failures.
